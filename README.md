# unWrapped


# Concept
A party planning web application that allows users to create and rsvp to parties while also keeping track of guests, gifts and if they sent a thank you note. 

# Project Overview
The party planning application, unWrapped, utilizes an express server and a MySQL database to track parties and RSVP’d guests. UnWrapped gives users the ability to create a party, which generates a random code that they can then share with guests. Guests use this party code to RSVP to the party. The user can then manage their party in a variety of ways — by seeing if any guests have RSVP’d and the party information, including date, time and location, as well as deleting the party from the database. The user can also update the RSVP guest list with the gift(s) the guest gifted and track if the user has sent a thank you note. And because users can also be invited to a party, they can track the parties that they have RSVP’d to.
